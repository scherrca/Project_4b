#Future Features
- Allow the user to customize a rubric that calculates their final rating. For instance, the user could designate "no on-call requirements" and "provides snacks" as checkpoints, and the final rating would be the sum of each checkpoint.
- Sort by “most recent action” date
- Sort by grade
- If the date is in the future: set alert to notify the user they have an appointment or interview coming up
- Check boxes:
Do you need to follow up with the person (i.e. email them after you met them at the meetup)
If yes: did you?
Do you need to send them a thank you?
If yes: did you?
- Alert the user if the user had said “yes” to the above and did not follow up or send a thank you: send alert
